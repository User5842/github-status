# Github Status

This application was inspired by the [Github Status](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/1-Beginner/GitHub-Status-App.md) app found on [florinpop17](https://github.com/florinpop17)'s repository.

The video counterpart can be found on my YouTube channel [And Bits of that Nature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReBn0lqq14c).
